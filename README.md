# Marathon-Enrollment-website
A web site that lets users sign up for the ficticious SDSU Marathon. The ficticious marathon will occur on Sunday December 4, 2016 and will start at the SDSU Library. You should make up any additional details needed.

Your project will consist of the following:

A main html5 page, with information on the marathon and a link to sign up as a runner.
A signup page. This page has the following fields:
First, Middle, and Last Name
Address, two lines for address, plus City, State, and Zipcode
Primary phone
Email address
Gender
Date of Birth
Medical Conditions (use a textarea)
Experience level (Expert, Experienced, Novice)
Category (Teen, Adult, Senior)
This is the first in a two-part assignment. This part is the client side and will involve only building the client side with the landing page and a form for enrollment as a runner.

For this part, you will use HTML5, CSS and Javascript to build the application. Form input must be validated as much as reasonable and possible using Javascript.
